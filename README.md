# aws-solution-architect-associate-study-notes

This is the study note for AWS solution architect associate certificate [SAA] where I've listed confusing concepts and their explanations in simple words. 

I've studied AWS official doc (especially the faq part) with the help of acloudguru SAA Udemy course and Jon Bonso SAA Practice Test. I found those materials are well structured and informative but too much words, which is not efficient to review and easily overwhelms my brain. 

This notes aims to provide a simple and searchable solution for review purpose. The notes has an index which lists confusing concepts in a few words and each concept has a hyperlink embedded that refers to a relatively more detailed but un-wordy explanation. You can use outline feature of google docs to return back to Index after finishing the explanation of a concept.

All explanations are from my own understanding, so accuracy is not guaranteed and it's best to take this notes as a supplemental material.

Enjoy your study!
